# mis2402semesterlongproject
The first chart in this project shows the top five states with the highest life expectancies for men in 2020.
The second chart shows the top five states with the highest life expectancies for women in 2020.
I chose this data to compare how life expectancies change in different states across the US.
Both charts use the API from the CDC, US State Life Expectancies by Sex, 2020: https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/U-S-State-Life-Expectancy-by-Sex-2020/ss2j-8ajj
